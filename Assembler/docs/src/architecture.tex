\section{Architecture}

\St{Karma} is a computer with a Von Neumann architecture with an address space of $2^{20}$ words, 32 bits each.

Each command takes up \textit{exactly one} word, 8 high bits of which specify the operation code and the use of the rest 24 bits is command-specific.

The processor has 16 one-word (32 bits each) registers \St{r0}-\St{r15}, as well as an additional \St{flags} register (also one-word).
Their usage is described in \hyperlink{registers}{Table 1}.
