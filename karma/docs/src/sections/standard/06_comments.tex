\subsection{Comments}

Each line may contain a hash sign (\#).
If it does, everything after the hash sign is considered a comment and
is not compiled into the executable file.
Multiline comments are not allowed.

Note that if hash sign is preceded with a backslash (\textbackslash)
it is not considered a comment start.
This allows for using a hash sign in \St{string} or \St{char} constants.
