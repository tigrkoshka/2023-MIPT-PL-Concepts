\paragraph{\St{itod}}\

The source modifier is added to the source register in
the \hyperlink{types:twos_complement}{common manner}, after which the resulting
\St{uint32} value is converted to \St{double} and stored into the two registers
starting from the specified receiver register.

\vspace{-0.35cm}

\paragraph{\St{dtoi}}\

The source modifier is ignored, but per our agreement must be present for simplicity.

The \St{double} value obtained from the two registers starting from the source
register is converted to \St{uint32} and stored into the receiver register.
If the value obtained after conversion does not fit into \St{uint32},
an execution error occurs.

\paragraph{\St{Real-valued arithmetic operators}}\

The source modifier is ignored for all real-valued arithmetic operators,
but per our agreement must be present for simplicity.
