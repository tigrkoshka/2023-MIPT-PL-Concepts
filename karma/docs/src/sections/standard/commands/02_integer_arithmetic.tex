\paragraph{\St{add}, \St{addi}, \St{sub}, \St{subi}}\

These commands take two \St{uint32} values obtained from the specified operands
(see \hyperlink{types:twos_complement}{the respective section} for details)
and produce a \St{uint32} value as a result.

In the mathematical sense of things, for the unsigned (as-is) interpretation of
the operands the arithmetic is simply performed modulo $2^{32}$.
E.g.\ if \St{r0} contained 0, after \St{subi\kern 0.35em r0\kern 0.35em 1},
the value in \St{r0} will be $2^{32}-1$.

At the same time, if both terms of each operation were to be interpreted as
\textit{signed} integral values in the 32-bit two's complement representation,
the result, if interpreted as a \textit{signed} integral value in the same
representation, would be mathematically correct.
That is provided by the two's complement representation of the signed operands
(see explanations for
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two\%27s_complement#Addition}{addition} and
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two\%27s_complement#Subtraction}
{subtraction}).

\paragraph{\St{mul}, \St{muli}}\

These commands multiply two \St{uint32} values obtained from the specified
operands (see \hyperlink{types:twos_complement}{the respective section}
for details), produce a \St{uint64} value and store it into the two registers
starting from the specified receiver register
(see \hyperlink{types:two_words_storage}{here} for details).

Unlike additive operations, these operations would not produce the correct
results if the factors were to interpreted as \textit{signed} integral values
in the 32-bit two's complement representation.
That is because in order to produce valid results in such a case,
the factors must first be \textit{extended} to the size of the destination type,
i.e.\ rewritten in the 64-bit two's complement representation (see
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two\%27s_complement#Multiplication}
{explanation}).
However, if we were to perform such an extension, we would block the opportunity
to multiply two big \textit{unsigned} values (because we would have interpreted
them as \textit{signed} values and added non-zero bits to the right of
the original representation when extending, thus producing an incorrect result
for this case).

Overall, one must be cautious when specifying the source modifier and
the immediate value in these operations, and bear in mind that if those produce
negative factors, they will firstly be converted to \St{uint32} by being taken
modulo $2^{32}$.

\paragraph{\St{div}, \St{divi}}\

These commands accept a \St{uint64} dividend from the two registers starting
from the specified receiver register (see \hyperlink{types:two_words_storage}{here}
for storage details) and a \St{uint32} divisor obtained in the
\hyperlink{types:twos_complement}{common manner} and perform an integral division.
The quotient is then placed into the receiver register and the remainder -- into
the next register.

If the quotient does not fit into a register, a \textit{quotient overflow}
execution error occurs.

Like the \St{mul} and \St{muli} commands, these command only work with
\textit{unsigned} operands and would not produce valid results if the operands
were to be interpreted as \textit{signed} integral values.
