\hypertarget{functions:prep}{}
Before pushing the function arguments to the stack, the following
preparatory actions must be performed:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Push the current value of the \St{r13} register
    (i.e.\ the stack pointer before the caller's local variables)
    to the stack \\
    As if with a \hspace{-0.1cm}\St{
        \makebox[0.85cm][l]{push}
        \makebox[0.6cm][l]{r13}
        \makebox[0.45cm][l]{0}
    }

    \item Set the \St{r13} register to the current stack pointer value
    (i.e.\ the value before the function arguments were pushed)\\
    As if with a \hspace{-0.1cm}\St{
        \makebox[0.60cm][l]{mov}
        \makebox[0.60cm][l]{r13}
        \makebox[0.60cm][l]{r14}
        \makebox[0.20cm][l]{0}
    }
\end{itemize}

After that, the code must push the arguments for the function to be called
to the stack last-to-first as described \hyperlink{karma:call:basic}{above}.

\hypertarget{functions:prologue}{}
The prologue of a function call does the following

\begin{itemize}
    \item Pushes the return address (i.e.\ the address of the next
    caller instruction, which is stored in the \St{r15} register)
    to the stack \\
    As if with a \hspace{-0.1cm}\St{
        \makebox[0.85cm][l]{push}
        \makebox[0.60cm][l]{r15}
        \makebox[0.45cm][l]{0}
    }

    \item Pushes the current value of the \St{r13} register (i.e.\ the value
    stored on the previous stage, which is the stack pointer value
    before the subprogram arguments were pushed) to the stack \\
    As if with a \hspace{-0.1cm}\St{
        \makebox[0.85cm][l]{push}
        \makebox[0.60cm][l]{r13}
        \makebox[0.45cm][l]{0}
    }

    \item Sets the \St{r13} register to the current stack pointer value
    (i.e.\ the value before the function local variables) \\
    As if with a \hspace{-0.1cm}\St{
        \makebox[0.60cm][l]{mov}
        \makebox[0.60cm][l]{r13}
        \makebox[0.60cm][l]{r14}
        \makebox[0.20cm][l]{0}
    }
\end{itemize}
