\hypertarget{executable}{
	\section{\St{Karma} executable file}
}

To run a program on a \St{Karma} computer one needs to generate an executable
file which contains meta-information about the machine code and the code itself.
The executable file is stored in a remote storage (e.g.\ a hard drive or an SSD)
as a byte sequence.
The header of the executable file takes up exactly 512 bytes.
The format of the executable file is described in
\hyperlink{flags:bits}{Table 5}.

Notes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The \St{ASCII} string at the beginning of the executable file contains
    15 explicit characters and an implicit `\textbackslash 0' at the end

    \item The code, constants and data segments sizes are denoted in bytes
    (as opposed to in machine words)

    \item The execution of the program starts from the instruction whose address
    is specified in the executable file header. \\
    This is the initial value of the \St{r15} register

    \item The header also specifies the initial stack head address \\
    This is the initial value of the \St{r14} register

    \item Currently a \St{Karma} executable file can run on only one processor
    -- that with ID 239

    \item The code, constants and data segments are loaded into the \St{Karma}
    computer consecutively, starting from the very first memory cell
    (i.e.\ the one with the 0 address)
\end{itemize}
