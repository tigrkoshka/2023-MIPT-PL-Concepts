# Playgrounds

This directory contains simple Karma assembler programs mainly used for testing
and demonstrating the sustainable and scalable Karma assembler code development
principles, including labels naming, comments writing and decomposition.

Each file in this directory contains a comment at the beginning explaining its
functionality and the educational purpose of the playground.

The recommended order of exploration, which leads to the most thorough
understanding of the Karma assembler code development principles:

* [hello_world_char_by_char.krm](hello_world_char_by_char.krm)
* [hello_world_smart.krm](hello_world_smart.krm)
* [factorial_loop.krm](factorial_loop.krm)
* [factorial_recursion.krm](factorial_recursion.krm)
* [fibonacci_loop](fibonacci_loop.krm)
* [fibonacci_recursion](fibonacci_recursion.krm)
* [square.krm](square.krm)
* [printf.krm](printf.krm)
