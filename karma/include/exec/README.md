## Exec

This directory provides the tools to read/write a Karma executable file,
which are used throughout the [karma library](../../include).

It also provides the types of the errors caused by an attempt to read a Karma
executable file, which are a part of the public interface of the
[karma library](../../include).

### Dependencies

Both the declarations and the definitions of the symbols from this directory
are dependent on and only on the symbols provided by
